# Measurable-Quantitative-Information-Annotation

This is a project for the 7th Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon ([BLAH7](https://blah7.linkedannotation.org/)), with a focus on Covid-19 literature.

Measurable quantitative information (MQI), as a set of information describes one of basic properties which is associated with the magnitude aspect of quantity, commonly exists in various types of text. Such information is much more abundant in scientific publications or technical reports to the extent that it constitutes an essential part of communicative segments of language in general. The fast-growing medical informatics research also needs to process a large amount of medical texts to analyze the dose of medicine, the eligibility criteria of clinical trial, the phenotype characters of patients, the lab tests in clinical records, etc. 

Thus, this project aims to accurately and consistently annotate measurable quantitative information from PubMed articles for facilitating automated processing, computation, and exchange of latest information for COVID-19 research.

The annotations can be applied to two sub-tasks: MQI identification and entity-quantity association. The MQI identification consists of the identification entities and associated quantifiable information. The entity-quantity association mainly focuses on the classification of the association types between entities and quantities in sentences. This is whole procedure.
